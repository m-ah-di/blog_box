# BlogBox
I was intended to build something like blog hosting service. Here, user can write articles and publish that with a visibility option such as private or public. After publishing as public, user will get a link (sharing link). By entering on that link anyone can read the article/blog which has been published.  To be a user, people have to create an account and also have to log in to be able to write. User will also get a friendly text editor to write &amp; format their article. Dashboard, which will be like a database of user’s articles. From there, user can access their articles, take actions such as edit or delete and will get the sharing link. Overall, the site is user friendly with an attractive look.
